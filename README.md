# Guided waves

In this homework, we are going to visualize the fields of guided waves to gain some intuition. We will start with examples of $TE_{10}$ wave and general $TE_{mn}$ waves, then you will apply similar methods to look at TM waves. Please see the jupyter notebook `waveguid.ipynb` for detailed description of the homwework.

## How to Run the Jupyter Notebook

### Running on your own machine

You can download the jupyter notebook to your own computer and run it. In order to run the jupyter notebook, you need to have python3 installed. Additionally, numpy, matplotlib,Jupyterlab are needed. You can install these by running the following commands in your terminal:

    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install jupyterlab

We use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to make movies. This is not a part of python and you need to install it separately.

After installing all the above dependendies, you can start jupyter lab interface from your terminal by the following command

    jupyter lab

This will open up a browser window with the jupyter lab interface.

Alternatively, you can open and run the jupyter notebook in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
